I was politely pointed out by my family (more like forcefully made to acknowledge) that I'm using phone too much. It is true, I'm not using the phone only when I'm driving, sleeping or working on a very difficult task at the office.

The screen time stats gave me a shocking revelation that I'm using phone a lot. I mostly read books in Kindle or articles from my Readwise library. Even though this is somewhat a productive usage, still the numbers are not indicating a healthy relationship with the phone. Instagram, Facebook (yes, I'm still using it) takes 3rd and 4th place of more used apps.

For all my over usage, still I don't pick up calls and hard to reach through calls. Text me, you'll get an instant reply. Lots of people told me that I'm the only one replying within minutes no matter the time for their texts. I don't know if being a perpetually connected person is doing any good to me.

I tried it before and always came back, but I decided to cut back my screen time. Main things I did is

1. Unsubscribed from lot of Subreddits that I was a member of.
    
2. Enabled privacy restrictions for Safari and disabled Facebook, Instagram, twitter, and reddit through websites.
    
3. Made the phone grayscale by applying a grayscale colour filter in accessibility settings.
    

Even after doing these extreme measures, I was still picking up my mobile a lot and disabling 2 & 3 temporarily. I know understand how substance addicts would feel. Insta and Facebook are really hard to resist and avoid.

#1 worked, Reddit is now boring and only lists software engineering related repeated questions. But no Instagram and Facebook are extremely addictive, I found myself accessing those from laptop often since phone is blocked. I also installed/uninstalled the Instagram app like 3, 4 times this week.

Since Mr.Zuckerberg is very persuasive, I deactivated my Facebook and Instagram accounts. This should stop me from accessing them easily from desktop as well. I do have some friends, writers on Facebook that I want to keep tabs to. But it is a small price to pay and missing out these things will not matter in the long run.

I don't know how long I can go with this, but worth giving a try. I do not want to deactivate twitter though. Because it is mostly about software development and is not as addictive as it used to be.

Now it is just Readwise Reader and Kindle. If Readwise started working on Kindle or just make it easier to send articles, I can reduce my screen time even further. Let's see if I can bring it down permanently this time.
