We've been warned by the wise not to make any important decisions when we're in the middle of serious emotion like angry or sad. But I think there is a flip side to it as well. We can't always make decisions by logic alone when there are uncertainty involved.

Purely basing your decisions on logic may lead you to be comfortably numb to any of the minor stuff happening around you. If you're stuck in a job that pays enough but doesn't lead you anywhere, the most logical decision is to stay on the job as long as possible in your comfort zone.

If you're in a relationship that is abusive, you'll eventually will break it up. But if you're in a relationship where it is just ok and not great for you, you're most likely to be stuck on the relationship.

In this case, a sudden surge of emotions such as anger could be the only way to find your way out. The emotion will push you to trust your instinct and find the courage to take the first step towards the change.

Why am I writing this? I'm very angry today and about to make a very important decision due to that. My logical brain screams at me to not to do anything right now, but I know that it is the last straw that broke the camel's back and I should do something about it.
